    <h2>What is Requirements Engineering?</h2>
    <p><strong>Requirements Engineering (RE)</strong> is a critical and systematic process in the field of software and systems development. It is the foundation upon which successful projects are built, ensuring that the final product meets the needs and expectations of its stakeholders.</p>

    <p>At its core, RE involves the identification, documentation, validation, and management of requirements. Requirements can be broadly categorized into two main types:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Functional Requirements:</strong> These describe what the system or software should do. They specify the system's behavior under different conditions and outline the functions it needs to perform. Functional requirements are typically expressed as use cases, scenarios, or user stories.</li>

        <li><strong>Non-Functional Requirements:</strong> Also known as quality attributes or constraints, non-functional requirements specify how the system should perform. They cover aspects such as performance, scalability, security, usability, and regulatory compliance. Non-functional requirements are often more challenging to quantify and prioritize than functional requirements.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The RE process encompasses several key activities:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Elicitation:</strong> This involves gathering requirements from various stakeholders, including end-users, customers, and subject matter experts. Techniques such as interviews, surveys, workshops, and observations are employed to extract valuable information about what the system should achieve.</li>

        <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Once requirements are collected, they must be analyzed to ensure clarity, consistency, and completeness. Analysts identify potential conflicts or contradictions between requirements and work to resolve them.</li>

        <li><strong>Specification:</strong> The gathered requirements are documented in a structured and unambiguous manner. This documentation serves as a contract between the development team and stakeholders, outlining what will be delivered.</li>

        <li><strong>Validation:</strong> Validation ensures that the specified requirements accurately reflect the stakeholders' needs. It involves verifying that the requirements are correct, complete, and feasible. Validation may also include techniques like prototyping to confirm that the envisioned system aligns with user expectations.</li>

        <li><strong>Management:</strong> Requirements change over the course of a project due to evolving business needs, shifting priorities, or new insights. Effective requirements management involves tracking changes, assessing their impact, and ensuring that the project stays aligned with the original objectives.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Successful RE relies on effective communication and collaboration between stakeholders, including business analysts, developers, testers, and project managers. Clear and concise documentation is essential to conveying requirements accurately and comprehensively.</p>

    <p>In the context of software development methodologies, such as Agile or Waterfall, RE plays a pivotal role. In Agile, requirements are frequently reviewed and adjusted as the project progresses, ensuring flexibility and responsiveness to changing demands. In Waterfall, the upfront specification of requirements is crucial to the subsequent phases of design, implementation, and testing.</p>
